  "statement": "Given two strings S and T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equal T. A subsequence is a sequence derived from string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of remaining characters.",
  "input_format": "First line contains string S.\nSecond line contains string T.",
  "output_format": "Print the count of distinct subsequences. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9+7.",
  "constraints": "1 <= |S|, |T| <= 1000\nStrings contain only lowercase English letters.",
