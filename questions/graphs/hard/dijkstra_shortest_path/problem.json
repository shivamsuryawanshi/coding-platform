  "statement": "Given a weighted directed graph with V vertices and E edges, find the shortest path from source vertex S to all other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm. If a vertex is unreachable, its distance is -1.",
  "input_format": "First line contains V, E, and S.\nNext E lines contain three integers U, V, and W representing an edge from U to V with weight W.",
  "output_format": "Print V space-separated integers representing shortest distances from S to vertices 0, 1, ..., V-1.",
  "constraints": "1 <= V <= 10^4\n0 <= E <= V*(V-1)\n0 <= S < V\n0 <= W <= 10^6",
