  "statement": "Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. A path is any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.",
  "input_format": "First line contains N (number of nodes including nulls in level order).\nSecond line contains N space-separated integers (-1 for null).",
